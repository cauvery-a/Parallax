      <p>“The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act.
        You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level.
        It's got to happen inside first.”</p>

      <p>“Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all.
        Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you.
        And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.”</p>

      <p>“Life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you.
         In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn't have the time to sit around and talk about you. What's important to me is not others' opinions of me, but what's important to me is my opinion of myself.”</p>
